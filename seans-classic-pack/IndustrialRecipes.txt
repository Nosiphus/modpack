(R = Rubber, C = Copper Ingot)
Cables can be placed on ground and act as wire for electric current.

 L
RCR = Switch Cable
 R
(L = Lever, C = Cable, R = Redstone Dust)
Switch cables are cabale of directing power, similar to the MFE.
If applied redstone, it will redirect all incoming currents upwards. Without redstone, it will redirect all incoming currents downwards.
This means, it can be used as cheap alternative to LINK multiple currents. (f.e. you can combine 4 currents in a cross, the center made of Switch cable, and it will redirect all 4 currents into a single directin)

CBC
BMB = MFE Transmitter
CBC
(C = Cable, B = RE Battery, M = Machine)
MFE are MultipleFunctionElectricity Transmitters.
They will accept electric current from all 6 sides and store up to 8 batterys worth of energy. As well, they will emit this electric energy if their top or bottom is wired.

Relays do not have any Energy-Saving functions and will continously emit all energy provided to them.
ATTENTION! While placing Relays it easyly can happen for them to charge up to 256 EU, sending an 256 EUs jolt once you connect anything to them. I recommend working on dry lines only.

Upon supplies with energy, it will start emitting currents, similar to the MFE Transmitter. However, it will either emit a current of 2000 EUs from the top OR a current of 50 EUs from the botton.
A current of 2000 EUs will suffer much less from distance-based EU loss then a current of below 50.
On the downside, high voltage is lethal and dangerous for normal machines and will instantly cause any machine it's applied to EXPLODE. To use the voltage, you need to wire the current into another Transformer and use the bottom output to turn the current into 50 EUs again.

It will automatically drop any mined ores on the surface, where they can be collected, easyly.
You can even withdraw the mining pipes, by putting ANY kind of block into the upper slot. The pipe will be withdrawn slowly, and replaced by the filler block (upper slot). Upon placing an item in the slot, the Miner will just withdraw the pipe, without placing any sort of filler.

YSR
S#S = Cultivation
DS.
(Y = Yellow Flower, R = Red Flower, S = Sapling, D = Dirt, . = Seed, # = TFBP)

SCS
S#S = Desertification
SCS
(S = Sand, C = Cactus, # = TFBP)
This TFBP will cause a Terraformer to turn it surrounding into a wide desert, removing plants (eventually even setting fires) and water, as well as snow and ice.

 W 
W#W = Irrigation
 W 
(W = Water Bucket (will not be consumed), # = TFBP)
This programm will make a Terraformer turning Sand into fertile Dirt, as well as increasing plant growth (Trees, Wheat).

SSS
S#S = Chilling
SSS
(S = Snowball, # = TFBP)

CSC
S#S = Compression
CSC
(C = Cobblestone, S = SmoothStone, # = TFBP)
This TFBP will start compressing the area around you. It will turn weaker materials (Dirt, Gravel, Sand, etc) into Cobblestone (or Sandstone, respectively, for Sand). As well, it will compress multiple layers of Sandstone/Cobblestone into Smoothstone.
In fact, this program will make the Terraformer free a landscape of anything but the stone below.

 S 
 #  = Flatificator
SSS
(S = Unused Stone Shovel, # = TFBP)
A highly useful program for builders.
A flatificating Terraformer will, on quite a decent speed, remove all basic natural block ABOVE IT'S OWN HEIGHT. It will not destroy any sort of stone or man-made materials, thus it could even be safe to use close to your house (unless your house is made of dirt).
IT's range is approx. a 41x41 area with the Terraformer in the middle.

All TFBP can be "reset" to their empty states by applying a charge.

 V
CMC = Tesla Coil
CAC
(V = HV transformer, M = Advanced Machine, C = Cable, A = Advanced Circuit)
Tesla Coils are deadly defense mechanism. They will require 5000 EU to fully charge up and 2 EUs while remaining active.
Tesla Coils will always charge up to 5000, but will not be active without being redstone-powered. (Thus, they need a trigger.)
If active and finding any alive object (including the player) within a small radius of approximately 4 blocks, they will zap said object with an extremely brutal 5000 EUs shock, dealing lethal damage to unarmored targets. After use, the tesla coils needs to recharge to 5000, again.

GGG
(L = Lapis Lazuli Block, F = FreqTrans, A = Advanced Machine, G = Glowstone dust)
Field Generators are complex machines, capable of creating near-inpenetrable protective barriers of cube-like shape.
However, it requires a constantly high supply of energy. The more energy (up to 256EUs) is supplied, the larger the shield dome will get.
Shield dome's are semi-visible and will flicker upon contact with objects. As well it can deal damage upon running into it.
A shield dome CAN be broken, however explosives are ned, and whatever gap ma< is created will fill within mere seconds.
Applying redstone to a Field Generator will disable it.
